# You can store numbers in variables.
# The standard rule is you write the variable name followed by = sign and the value it will take

x=5


x


y=6.4
y


print(y)





# Addition
z = x+y

print(z)


# Printing the memory address the variable z occupies
print(hex(id(z)))





# Subtraction
z = x-y

# Use the in-built print function to print the variable
print(z)


# Printing the memory address the variable z occupies
print(hex(id(z)))


 # Find out the data type of variable z
type(y)


# Multiplication
z = x*y

print(z)  # Print the variable z
type(z)   # Get the data type of variable z


# Division
z = x/y

print(z) # Print the variable z
type(z)  # Get the data type of variable z


# Floor division
z= x//y  #  Remember x=5, y=6.4
print(z)





# Modulo operator
y=5
x=3

z = y%x       # Modulus is denoted by % sign
print(z)


# Using powers and exponents

z = x**y    # We did not even need to store it in another variable nor use print command
print(z)


# BODMAS nostalgia
