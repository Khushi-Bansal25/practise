    "#### The SETI Institute is a not-for-profit research organization incorporated in 1984 whose mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe, and to apply the knowledge gained to inspire and guide present and future generations. It aims for discovery and for sharing knowledge as scientific ambassadors to the public, the press, and the government. SETI stands for the \"Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\".\n",

    "#### SETI received some signals from a far away galaxy on June 14, 2012. These signals could have been from a possible alien civilization (similar to what you would have seen in the movie Arrival).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The signals indicated the existence of a secret language for sending messages across. Following are the observations made by the SETI team who discovered these signals :\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Aliens share a **tuple**, each element of tuple will be a **string** of alphabets\n",
    "*   Scientists still don't know what is the content of the strings inside the tuples but depending upon the length of the string, the string translates into an alphabet (0 ≡  ,1 ≡ A, 2 ≡ B, 3 ≡ C, .., 26 ≡ Z)\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
